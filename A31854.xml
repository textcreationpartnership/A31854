            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Kings <hi>DECLARATION For a</hi> PACIFICATION.</head>
            <p>THe Kings Majeſtie to declare that he is ful of Mercie as well as Juſtice, deſiring not the effuſion of his Subjects blood, doth by a late Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation declare, Thatwhereas it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſuſpected that he favoured the malignant party, and thoſe that are Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected, hee doth diſavow and proteſt againſt all ſuſpitions, ever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion, and the good of his Subjects, and doth therefore moſt earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that all matters of difference might be reconciled betwixt him and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, though many rumors have bin ſpread abroad that he hath ſought the ruine and deſtruction thereof, and hath for that purpoſe raiſed this preſent great
<pb facs="tcp:42695:3"/>Army, but now ſince the great battaile at <hi>Kenton</hi> neere <hi>Banbury,</hi> he doth ſhew himſelfe a right noble King, in deſiring his Subjects not to be miſtaken in his intents, but confidently to beleeve that he deſires nothing more then that they would upon good tearms lay downe their Arms, &amp; that thereupon he would receive them againe into his gracious mercy &amp; favour: what can be ſaid more by a King unto his Subjects: who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their preſervation, if by any faire meanes it may be obtained, doth deſire them to embrace the gracious offer of Peace: what love can be greater then for a King to intreat his Subjects, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to be good unto themſelves, &amp; not to proceed in theſe violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which muſt needs be the ruine and deſtruction of the Kingdom. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that for what is paſt, he will not
<pb facs="tcp:42695:3"/>think the worſe of any of them, and if they will now return to their former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he will moſt lovingly forget all oppoſition made by them, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that they have been miſ-led by ſome factious advice to ſtand in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of defending Religion and his Perſon, when by theſe violent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, they goe about to deſtroy both. But on the contrary, it hath pleaſed his Majeſty to declare, that if they ſtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to certifie matters by a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in oppoſing his Majeſtie, and doe contribute Plate, Money, or any other aſsiſtance to theſe preſent wars, he will account them open enemies againſt his Perſon, and the ſtate of the Kingdome. But if they will ſubmit unto his mercy, and proceed no further in a war-like manner, to take up Arms upon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretences, but lay down thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb facs="tcp:42695:4"/>ready taken, he will give unto all his Subjects a free pardon for all former acts, and will no more remember any former paſſages, even from the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this diſſention between the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>And moreover, for the preventing of great effuſion of blood, &amp; the ſetling of matters, whereby the Kingdom may flouriſh as it formerly hath done, the King led thereunto by his own royall diſpoſition, doth deſire that certaine grave and ſubſtantiall Citizens may be choſen to reconcile matters of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his Majeſty and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that he will in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appoint ſome equall in fidelity and underſtanding to conſult with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great affaires of the Kingdom; and what they ſhall agree upon, he will ratifie and make good by conſenting to
<pb facs="tcp:42695:4"/>all their Acts and Conſultations, that ſo this Civil-warre, which hath bred ſo great a diſturbance in the Kingdome, may proceed no further, a pacification and beace being made on both ſides, to the generall content of the King, the Parliament, and all his royall Subjects.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <p>It is moſt certain that the requeſts of a King have a commanding power, and howſoever ſome skilfull in calumnious reports, ſeeke to cheriſh and increaſe the unhappy diſagreement betweene the King and people, yet in the wiſdome of thoſe that are beſt affected, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is thought to be a more ready way to procure the peace and happineſſe of this Kingdome, then that all grudges and jelouſies may be removed, &amp; matters well ſtated and ſetled for the good of the Commonwealth, whereupon wil follow a cleere underſtanding between Prince and people, continued together in a mutuall league of deareſt affection, it being the wonder of the Land, and the joy of forraign Nations, that there ſhould be any diſagreement between our Soveraign &amp; his Subjects, eſpecially a Civil war, the like whereof, theſe many hundred yeeres hath not been known<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>England.</hi> It will be therefore very f;it not to ſeek too far into the cauſes of the Kings diſpleaſure, or of the preſent diſagreement of the King and Parliament, ſince all humane actions, whether of the Prince or people are ſubject unto ſuch errors as cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb facs="tcp:42695:5"/>but by a Divine power; Many things may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a State for the puniſhment thereof, that the people be in grown ripe in their ſins, may on a ſudden bee cut downe and the ſword of the Prince may execute the decree of divine revenge; And againe, the people miſ-led by factious counſel, may be drawn to oppoſe their King, (I ſay no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that they are) ſince to excuſe in an equall manner cannot be thought to be any particular condemnation, but in regard that both are ſubject to error, it may be without offence concluded, that it were beſt with a cleere underſtanding to look into the occaſion of this Civil war, whereof ſome perhaps are utterly ignorant, and others upon falſe grounds think it fit to be maintained: And therefore to ſhun theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of opinion, it wil be the ſafeſt and moſt peaceable courſe to deſire that there might be a Pacification and agreement between the Prince and the people, and his moſt loyall Parliament, which his Majeſty in a late Proclamation hath moſt graciouſly offered.</p>
               <p>For let all Subjects conſider the premiſes of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowing all Papiſts, and proteſting to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion, his deſiring of peace betweene himſelfe and his Parliament; his offer of pardon to all his loving Subjects, earneſtly requeſting them to lay down their Arms; his proteſting that he doth and will ſeek to avoid the effuſion of bloud; and laſtly his offer of eſtabliſhing a peace by Counſellers elected on both ſides, and all this will be ſufficient to work a deſire of reconcilement between the King and his Subjects.</p>
